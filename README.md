# 🧠 Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains **clean, well-documented implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms from scratch**, using only fundamental Python libraries such as `NumPy` and `Matplotlib`.

The goal is **deep understanding**, not library usage.

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Most ML practitioners use high-level libraries without understanding what happens underneath.  
This project is designed to:

- Understand ML algorithms mathematically
- Implement them step-by-step
- Analyze their strengths and weaknesses
- Compare them with standard library implementations

This repository is also intended as **educational material** for students and researchers.

## 📌 What “From Scratch” Means

✔ No `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `lightgbm`  
✔ Only `numpy`, `math`, `matplotlib`  
✔ Explicit loss functions, gradients, and optimization

## 📚 Implemented Algorithms

### Supervised Learning

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree

### Unsupervised Learning

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Ensemble Methods

- Bagging

- Boosting (Introductory)

---

## 📐 Mathematical Foundations

- Linear Algebra
- Probability Theory
- Optimization Techniques

All derivations are explained intuitively in the `math/` directory.

---

## Benchmarks

Each algorithm is compared against its `scikit-learn` counterpart in terms of:

- Performance
- Accuracy
- Runtime

---

## Educational Value

This repository is structured to:

- Help students learn ML fundamentals
- Support teaching and mentoring
- Serve as a research-ready portfolio
